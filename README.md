⚡ Fun Fact  
I’m the kind of person who’ll spend hours getting that **perfect button animation** — because details matter! I believe a good user experience can change the way people interact with technology. Also… I design better when there’s coffee and lo-fi beats involved ☕🎧

Thanks for stopping by! Let's build something amazing together 💫
